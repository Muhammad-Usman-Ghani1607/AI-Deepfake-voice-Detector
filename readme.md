ðŸ”Š Deepfake Voice Detection
This project is a Streamlit application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether a given audio or video file contains a real or fake (AI-synthesized) voice.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… File Conversion:
Converts uploaded files (audio or video) into a standardized mono, 16 kHz .wav format using pydub and ffmpeg.

âœ… Mel-Spectrogram Extraction:
Transforms audio signals into Mel-Spectrograms with librosa and converts them into decibel scale.

âœ… CNN Model:
A custom PyTorch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to distinguish real from fake based on Mel-Spectrogram patterns.

âœ… Streamlit UI:
Provides a simple and interactive UI for uploading files and viewing results directly in the browser.

âœ… Clean-up:
Removes temporary files after processing to keep storage clean.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Framework: Streamlit

Deep Learning: PyTorch

Signal Processing: Librosa, pydub, ffmpeg

Other: NumpY for numerical operations

ðŸš€ How To Run
streamlit run app.py

âž¥ Step 1: Upload an audio or video file (wav, mp3, ogg, m4a, opus, or mp4).

âž¥ Step 2: The application converts it to a standardized .wav.

âž¥ Step 3: Mel-spectrogram is extracted and fed into the trained CNN.

âž¥ Step 4: The UI displays whether the voice is Real or Fake.

âœ… This pipeline lets you quickly and accurately classify deepfake audio files with a friendly UI.
